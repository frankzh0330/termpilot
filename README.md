# TermPilot

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

## Overview

`TermPilot` is a terminal-native AI coding assistant implemented in Python. It can read and edit files, execute commands, search code, call external tools, and manage long-running coding sessions from the command line.

It is already usable for day-to-day coding tasks and continues to evolve toward a more complete, production-ready terminal agent experience.

## Highlights

- Multi-provider API support: Anthropic, OpenAI, Zhipu GLM, DeepSeek, and Seed
- Streaming responses with Markdown-friendly terminal rendering
- Quiet terminal UI with staged status updates, compact tool cards, and on-demand detail expansion
- Tool-use loop: the model can call tools repeatedly until the task is complete
- Concurrent tool execution for safe tools, serialized execution for unsafe tools
- Permission system with five modes, persistent rules, path validation, and dangerous-command detection
- Hook system for shell-command hooks around prompts and tool calls
- Automatic `TERMPILOT.md` loading for project-level persistent instructions
- Context compaction for long conversations
- Session persistence with resumable JSONL history, session rewind, and crash recovery
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for API rate limits and transient failures
- MCP integration for dynamic tools and resources
- Skills and slash commands
- Delegation-oriented sub-agents: Explore, Plan, Verification, general-purpose, and user-defined custom agents (loaded from `~/.termpilot/agents/*.md`)
- Plan Mode: press Shift+Tab to cycle between Default, Accept Edits, and Plan modes; models in Plan mode are read-only and present plans for user approval
- Persistent memory, undo snapshots, token/cost tracking, large tool-result storage, and attachments

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `pip`

### Install

```bash
pip install termpilot
```

To upgrade later:

```bash
pip install -U termpilot
```

### Configure

On first launch, TermPilot will guide you through an interactive setup:

```bash
termpilot
```

You'll see a provider selector:

```
? Select your LLM provider:
  > Anthropic (Claude)
    OpenAI
    Zhipu GLM
    DeepSeek
    Seed
```

Select your provider, enter your API key, and you're ready to go.

To reconfigure later:

```bash
termpilot model
```

Or manually edit `~/.termpilot/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "provider": "zhipu",
  "env": {
    "ZHIPU_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
    "ZHIPU_BASE_URL": "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4",
    "ZHIPU_MODEL": "glm-5.1"
  }
}
```

The setup wizard intentionally keeps the provider list short. Supported setup providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Zhipu GLM, DeepSeek, and Seed. Existing OpenAI-compatible settings can still be configured manually with `TERMPILOT_BASE_URL`, `TERMPILOT_API_KEY`, and `TERMPILOT_MODEL`.

Environment variables override `settings.json`.

### Run

```bash
termpilot
termpilot -p "Read main.py"
termpilot -m gpt-4o
termpilot --resume
termpilot -s <session-id>
```

### Common Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/details last`, `/details <n>` | Show the full output for the most recent or a specific tool result |
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/compact` | Trigger manual context compaction |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation history |
| `/config` | Show effective configuration |
| `/model` | Switch the active model for the current provider |
| `/skills` | List available skills |
| `/mcp` | Show MCP server status |
| `/undo` | Restore the previous file snapshot |
| `/rewind` | Rewind conversation to a previous turn and continue from there |
| `/commit` | Draft a commit flow with AI-generated commit message guidance |
| `/init` | Generate a project instruction seed for the current project |
| `/exit`, `/quit` | Exit the program |

## Sub-Agents

The `agent` tool delegates work to sub-agents that run in an isolated context with their own system prompt and tool set. Sub-agents can call tools until the task is complete, then return a final summary to the main agent.

TermPilot keeps the public tool name `agent`, but its intended semantics are closer to `delegate_task`: use `Plan` for implementation strategy, `Explore` for broad codebase understanding, `Verification` for checks and tests, and `general-purpose` for complex autonomous execution. For multiple independent directions, the model can pass a `tasks` array and delegate up to 3 sub-agents in one call. Batch delegation currently runs serially for predictable UI, permission, and result ordering.

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Explore` | Fast read-only agent for codebase exploration, architecture analysis, file discovery, and code searches |
| `Plan` | Architect agent for designing implementation strategies and exploring trade-offs |
| `Verification` | Read-only agent for checking diffs, running tests, and identifying regressions |
| `general-purpose` | General agent for complex multi-step tasks with full tool access |
| Custom | User-defined agents loaded from `~/.termpilot/agents/*.md` with frontmatter metadata |

See [Task Delegation and Sub-Agent Routing](docs/task-delegation.md) for the design background and implementation details.

### Custom Agents

Create a Markdown file in `~/.termpilot/agents/` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality, security, and best practices
tools: read_file, glob, grep
---

You are a code review specialist. Analyze the code and report findings.
```

## Plan Mode

Press **Shift+Tab** to cycle between permission modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Default | Normal operation with permission prompts |
| Accept Edits | Auto-approve file edits within the working directory |
| Plan | Read-only mode — only exploration and planning tools are allowed |

In Plan mode, the model explores the codebase and designs an implementation plan, then calls `exit_plan_mode` to present the plan for your approval via an interactive dialog. After approval, the mode restores to the previous setting.

A bottom toolbar shows the current mode (yellow for Plan, green for Accept Edits, gray for Default).

## Architecture Summary

Main runtime flow:

1. `cli.py` collects user input and renders streamed output.
2. `context.py` builds the system prompt from environment, config, memory, and project instructions.
3. `api.py` calls the model, gathers `tool_use` blocks, and orchestrates tool execution.
4. `hooks.py` runs pre/post hooks and prompt/session hooks.
5. `permissions.py` decides whether each tool call is allowed, denied, or requires confirmation.
6. Tool results are returned to the model until it stops requesting tools.

## Reference Implementation

The project is still being refined with reference to an upstream TypeScript implementation, but `TermPilot` keeps its own product identity, packaging, and documentation.

## UI Notes

- The default CLI experience is intentionally quiet: long raw tool output is collapsed into compact cards instead of being printed in full.
- When the model is still gathering context, the CLI shows short-lived staged statuses such as `Coalescing…`, project inspection, and summarization.
- Permission prompts use a keyboard-friendly menu (`↑` / `↓` + Enter) instead of numeric input.

## Development

If you want to work on TermPilot locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frankzh0330/termpilot.git
cd termpilot

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
termpilot
```

For local quality checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/check.py
```
