# TermPilot

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

## Overview

`TermPilot` is a terminal-native AI coding assistant implemented in Python. It can read and edit files, execute commands, search code, call external tools, and manage long-running coding sessions from the command line.

It is already usable for day-to-day coding tasks and continues to evolve toward a more complete, production-ready terminal agent experience.

## Highlights

- Multi-provider API support: Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, and compatible providers such as Zhipu GLM
- Streaming responses with Markdown-friendly terminal rendering
- Tool-use loop: the model can call tools repeatedly until the task is complete
- Concurrent tool execution for safe tools, serialized execution for unsafe tools
- Permission system with five modes, persistent rules, path validation, and dangerous-command detection
- Hook system for shell-command hooks around prompts and tool calls
- Automatic `CLAUDE.md` loading for project-level persistent instructions
- Context compaction for long conversations
- Session persistence with resumable JSONL history and generated conversation titles
- MCP integration for dynamic tools and resources
- Skills and slash commands
- Persistent memory, undo snapshots, token/cost tracking, large tool-result storage, attachments, and sub-agents

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `pip`

### Install

```bash
pip install termpilot
```

If you want Anthropic support, install the optional extra:

```bash
pip install "termpilot[anthropic]"
```

To upgrade later:

```bash
pip install -U termpilot
```

### Configure

Set your provider credentials in `~/.termpilot/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
  }
}
```

OpenAI official endpoint:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "env": {
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-openai-api-key",
    "OPENAI_MODEL": "gpt-4o"
  }
}
```

Zhipu GLM endpoint:

```json
{
  "provider": "zhipu",
  "env": {
    "ZHIPU_API_KEY": "your-zhipu-api-key",
    "ZHIPU_BASE_URL": "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4",
    "ZHIPU_MODEL": "glm-4-flash"
  }
}
```

Generic OpenAI-compatible providers such as DeepSeek, Qwen/DashScope, Moonshot, SiliconFlow, OpenRouter, Groq, Together, Fireworks, Ollama, or self-hosted vLLM:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai_compatible",
  "env": {
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-provider-key",
    "OPENAI_BASE_URL": "https://your-provider.example.com/v1",
    "OPENAI_MODEL": "your-model-name"
  }
}
```

Supported configuration patterns:

- `provider = "anthropic"` with `ANTHROPIC_*`
- `provider = "openai"` with `OPENAI_*`
- `provider = "openai_compatible"` with `OPENAI_*` or `TERMPILOT_*`
- provider aliases like `zhipu`, `deepseek`, `qwen`, `moonshot`, `siliconflow`, `openrouter`, `groq`, `together`, `fireworks`, `ollama`, and `vllm`

Environment variables override `settings.json`.

### Run

```bash
termpilot
termpilot -p "Read main.py"
termpilot -m gpt-4o
termpilot --resume
termpilot -s <session-id>
```

### Common Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/compact` | Trigger manual context compaction |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation history |
| `/config` | Show effective configuration |
| `/skills` | List available skills |
| `/mcp` | Show MCP server status |
| `/undo` | Restore the previous file snapshot |
| `/commit` | Draft a commit flow with AI-generated commit message guidance |
| `/init` | Generate a project instruction seed for the current project |
| `/exit`, `/quit` | Exit the program |

## Architecture Summary

Main runtime flow:

1. `cli.py` collects user input and renders streamed output.
2. `context.py` builds the system prompt from environment, config, memory, and project instructions.
3. `api.py` calls the model, gathers `tool_use` blocks, and orchestrates tool execution.
4. `hooks.py` runs pre/post hooks and prompt/session hooks.
5. `permissions.py` decides whether each tool call is allowed, denied, or requires confirmation.
6. Tool results are returned to the model until it stops requesting tools.
